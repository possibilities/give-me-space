By my estimation the "Hello World" of the modern web app is connecting to Twitter (or some other popular API) and doing *something* with the data. Extra credit if you mashup two APIs and make sexy realtime visual magic. For Meteor I went kept it pretty minimal. [tweeteor](http://tweeteor.meteor.com) shows tweets from Twitter's public timeline. Not very interesting but it gave me a chance to cut my teeth building a Meteor app. Since then I've built a bunch of tools and this blog. Normally I'd say a blog app is less interesting than an app that can talk to an API and display data in real-time but in the case of Meteor it provided many opportunities to write new tools, learn new things, and reconsider how a web app can be built.

Welcome to my blog... I'll definitely have more to say about the [tools](https://github.com/possibilities) I've been building and there are many things left to make the blog itself better. Until then check out the [source code](https://github.com/possibilities/moon-blog) and stay tuned for more Meteor talk.
